  Edit an Instagram draft so it matches the user's voice, removing accidental
  invisible characters and generic stock phrasing, then report five transparent
  style heuristics. Use whenever text needs to sound natural, when the
  user says humanize, "does this sound like AI", "remove the em dashes",
  "de-slop this", "this sounds like ChatGPT", or before any caption, script,
  comment, reply or DM is shown to the user.

# ig-human

Before using this skill, read [the shared safety and trust rules](../../references/safety.md).

Two local editorial tools live in this folder. Use them as diagnostics, not as
proof of authorship or a way to evade detection systems. Resolve their paths
relative to this `SKILL.md`; do not assume the current working directory.

```bash
python3 humanize.py draft.txt --report        # clean it, show what changed
python3 detect.py draft.txt                    # score it, five checks
python3 detect.py before.txt after.txt         # prove the delta
python3 detect.py borrador.txt --lang es       # force Spanish heuristics
```

Both read `slop.json`, which includes English and Spanish stock phrasing,
invisible character classes, typographic substitutions, and structural tells.
It is meant to be edited. If the user deliberately uses a word or typographic
mark, preserve it or remove that rule from the lexicon.

## Why this matters more on Instagram than it looks

Captions are short and scripts get said out loud. A written-sounding line in a
600-character caption is a larger share of the text than the same line in an
essay, and a voiceover that nobody could say naturally is obvious in the first
take. The tell here is not a detector flagging the post. The tell is a person
scrolling past something that reads like a brand, or a creator stumbling over
their own script.

## What gets fixed automatically

**1. Invisible characters.** Zero-width spaces and joiners, word joiners, soft
hyphens, byte-order marks, Unicode tag characters, invisible separators,
non-breaking and narrow spaces. A keyboard does not produce these. They survive
copy-paste, they are invisible in every editor, and they are the most
mechanical thing in generated text. `humanize.py` deletes every one, including
any remaining Unicode format character it does not have a name for.

**2. Typography.** Em dash to comma, en dash to hyphen, curly quotes to
straight, ellipsis to three dots, bullet character to hyphen. The em dash pass
is the one that matters: it collapses the dash to a comma and then cleans up
the double punctuation and orphaned periods that leaves behind.

**3. The slop lexicon.** delve, leverage, robust, seamless, crucial, testament
to, "in today's fast-paced world", plus the Instagram block: "stop scrolling",
"in today's video", "follow for more", "tag someone who needs this", "the
algorithm loves", "run don't walk". Each swapped for a plain word or deleted,
with capitalisation preserved and URLs left untouched.

## What does NOT get fixed automatically

Structural tells get **flagged, not rewritten**, because changing the shape of
a sentence needs judgement:

- "It's not just X, it's Y" and "not only X but also Y"
- Rule-of-three triads
- Rhetorical one-word question lines: "The result?"
- The video preamble: "in this video I'm going to show you"
- Emoji bullet lists
- Three or more shouted words in a row
- Hashtag walls
- Reflex bait: "follow for more", "tag someone who", "double tap if"

That list is your job. Rewrite each flagged line by hand, keeping the meaning,
then re-run `detect.py`. This is the part that moves the score from REVIEW to
PASS, and it is the part a script cannot do.

## The five style checks

`detect.py` scores five signals 0-100, higher is more human:

| check | what it measures | machine looks like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BURSTINESS | sentence-length variation | every sentence the same length |
| SPECIFICITY | numbers, names, concrete markers per 100 words | abstract nouns, no figures |
| SLOP DENSITY | lexicon hits per 100 words | stock vocabulary |
| FINGERPRINT | invisible chars, em dashes, curly quotes per 1k chars | typographically perfect |
| VOICE | contractions, person, structural tells | no contractions, staged reveals |

The verdict weights the mean at 60% and the **weakest single check** at 40%,
because one signal is enough. PASS needs an overall of 70+ with no check
below 55.

## Say this honestly

These are five local style heuristics. They run entirely on the user's machine
and nothing is uploaded. They do not determine whether a person or model wrote
the text, do not call detector services, and must never be described as making
text "undetectable". The user's meaning and voice outrank the score.

## Order of operations

1. `humanize.py draft.txt -o clean.txt --report`
2. Read the structural flags. Rewrite those lines yourself.
3. `detect.py draft.txt clean.txt` to show the before and after.
4. If the verdict is not PASS, fix the weakest check named in the output and go
   again. Two rounds is normal. Five means the draft was written by formula,
   and the fix is a different draft, not more passes.
5. Show the user the cleaned text and the score. Never the score alone.
